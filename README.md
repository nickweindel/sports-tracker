# Sports Game Tracker

A web application built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **ShadCN UI** and deployed with **Vercel**, designed to track sports games across different leagues and venues. Users can view, add, and delete game data, as well as analyze venue and team stats.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- **Package Manager**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Database Schema

```sql
create table public.games (
  user_email text not null,
  game_id integer not null,
  league text not null,
  game_date date not null,
  home_team text not null,
  home_team_name text not null,
  home_team_score integer not null,
  home_team_logo text not null,
  home_team_rank integer null,
  away_team text not null,
  away_team_name text not null,
  away_team_score integer not null,
  away_team_logo text not null,
  away_team_rank integer null,
  game_center_link text null,
  arena text not null,
  arena_city text null,
  arena_state text null,
  arena_country text null,
  constraint games_pkey primary key (
    user_email,
    game_id,
    league,
    game_date,
    home_team,
    away_team
  )
)

create table public.rank_override (
  game_id integer not null,
  league text not null,
  home_team_rank integer null,
  away_team_rank integer null,
  constraint rank_override_pkey primary key (game_id, league)
)

create table public.team_override (
  league text not null,
  team_abbreviation text not null,
  team_abbreviation_override text null,
  team_logo text null,
  constraint team_override_pkey primary key (league, team_abbreviation)
)
```

Rank override handles college sports games where one or more teams has the incorrect ranking. Team override is a way to handle teams that have relocated or have different abbreviations to ensure consistency in logos and abbreviations. Long-term, this should be handled in a more elegant way, such as using a team ID. An example is the Oakland Athletics. Their old logo, `oak.png` is not found anymore on ESPN's website, so it needs to be hardcoded to `ath.png`.

## API Routes

| Route                        | Method | Description                           |
|-----------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `/api/games`                | GET    | Fetch all game records                |
| `/api/games`                | POST   | Add a new game                        |
| `/api/games`                | DELETE | Delete a game                         |
| `/api/arenas`               | GET    | Get count of games per arena          |
| `/api/teams`                | GET    | Fetch a team's record                 |
| `/api/[sports]/[league]`    | GET    | Get league-specific game data         |

## Assets

- League icons and logos are stored in `/public/league-logos`
- Other generic icons are stored directly in `/public`
- Assets are used in UI components like dropdowns and cards

---

## Notes

- The app is built using the **App Router** in Next.js (`/src/app`)
- Currently functions as a single-page dashboard (`page.tsx`)
- Uses modular API routes for fetching and updating game data
- The database table has a composite primary key to ensure uniqueness
- Ideal for tracking in-person sports attendance, scores, and venues

---

## TODOs / Improvements

- [ ] Integrate automated handling of certain edge cases (e.g. relocated teams, neutral sites, etc.)
- [ ] Create analytics (e.g. top goal scorers for NHL games, winning pitchers for MLB games, etc.)
- [ ] Refactor game selection to require less manual input (i.e. create a dropdown of selectable games once a league is selected)
- [ ] Allow ability to share games attended with others (i.e. have a view-only mode)
